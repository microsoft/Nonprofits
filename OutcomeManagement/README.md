# Outcome Management

Outcome Management is an extensible, model-driven template app built on the Microsoft Power Platform. It is designed to help nonprofits modernize their impact measurement efforts and prepare for future innovation with a foundation that is focused on data and AI. By using this app, partners can help customers gain insights on outcomes and impacts across their program portfolio.

Outcome Management helps nonprofits manage the impact of programs, projects, and activities. It enables program managers to establish goals and indicators, measure results, aggregate impact across programs, and more easily share outcomes with stakeholders. Outcome Management enables users to:

- Create a complete picture of individual and organizational constituents, including program participants and stakeholders, by type, demographics, relationships, contact methods, and communication preferences.
- Manage key information across program and project lifecycles, from strategic objectives to stakeholder measurement.
- Define and adapt programs and projects based on output, outcome, and results.
- Manage impact indicators and measurements.

Outcome Management is built on the [Common Data Model (CDM) for Nonprofits](https://aka.ms/GitHubCDMforNonprofits), an industry-led, open-source data schema that reflects industry best practices and connects data across the organization to enable powerful interoperability, fuel greater insight and efficacy, and provide data transparency. With the CDM and Power Platform as the foundation, Outcome Management connects with other platforms and applications in a seamless data flow, increasing operational efficiency and enabling data-driven decision-making.
