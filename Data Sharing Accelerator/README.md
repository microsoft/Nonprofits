# Data Sharing Accelerator

The Disaster Response Data Sharing Accelerator is a solution that provides near real-time data sharing based on an open data standard during a disaster or similar event. This first package on GitHub has been developed to share data between participating partner organizations. It provides a medium for organizations in need of resources (food, water, etc.) to connect with organizations that have those resources available. This solution will also work beyond the initial use case such as for assessments.

The first proof-of-concept deployment for this solution was with a public-private-nonprofit partnership titled ‘Cascadia Disaster Response Exercise’, which simulated a response to a category 9 earthquake in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. The package contains code and documentation needed for a tabletop exercise and can be leveraged for real-world disaster response deployment where timely data flow and coordination across partnering organizations are key.

You can find the functioning solution as well as documentation on how to implement it and how to use it here: [Data Sharing Accelerator](https://github.com/microsoft/Data-Sharing-Accelerator)
