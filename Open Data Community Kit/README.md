# Open Data Community Kit

## 1. What is the Open Data Community Kit?

The Open Data Community Kit is a repository-based approach for a group collaborative to create an open data commons.
Open data is increasingly instrumental to solve some of the most intricate problems of the 21st century. However most open datasets today are releases of proprietary datasets made available under an open data agreement, and are still rarely the result of an open collaboration process. We hope the Open Data Community Kit will make it easier to collaborate to that end.
