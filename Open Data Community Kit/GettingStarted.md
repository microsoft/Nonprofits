# Getting Started

## 1. Copy the [OpenDataCommons](OpenDataCommons) folder to your repo

The OpenDataCommons folder contains the most basic elements you need to run an Open Data Commons project. It contains:
- the data sharing agreement applying to both contributing Data to the Commons and sharing the Data Commons with others (which really is the same thing)
- the governance document describing the fundamentals of your project, such as roles, decision making, publication, etc.
- a document to describe your project, the kind of data you're looking for, etc.


## 2. Edit the [Description.md](OpenDataCommons/Description.md) file

As the Data Commons Maintainer, you must decide what kind of Data should go in the Commons. While this is likely to evolve, it is a good idea to make that clear upfront so that Data contributors know what to expect. While the scope is meant to be stable over time, having a separate file dedicated to describing the kind of Data you want will make it easier to handle changes as relevant.

## 3. Edit the [Participants.md](OpenDataCommons/Participants.md) file

The Participants.md file keeps track of the Data Commons Maintainer(s) and of the Data Commons participants. This file will help track that Data Commons Providers have accepted the data agreement, even after they have left the project.

## 4. What about the other files?

You should not edit the [DataAgreement.md](OpenDataCommons/DataAgreement.md) nor the [Governance.md](OpenDataCommons/Governance.md) files. If you have an idea of how to improve them, consider making a pull request.

You can record the important decisions for your Open Data Commons in the [Decisions.md](OpenDataCommons/Decisions.md) file. It is optional though.
