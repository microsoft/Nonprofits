# Nonprofit Data Warehouse Quickstart

Data warehouses enable organizations to get the most out of their data by aggregating multi-source data and transforming it so that organizations can layer analytics and generate important insights. 

The Nonprofit Data Warehouse Quickstart is a pre-packaged, ‘one-click deployment,’ Azure based data warehouse solution. The Quickstart integrates sample data from IATI and The WHO Water and Sanitation Report and the Quickstart with CDM integrates with the [Microsoft Common Data Model Nonprofit Accelerator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/common-data-model/nfp-accelerator).  To assist with deployment of the solution, these assets (in this order) will help guide the experience:
