## Common Data Model for Nonprofit Sample Applications

The [**Nonprofit Accelerator**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/industry/accelerators/nfp) sample apps combine standard Common Data Model entities with customized nonprofit entities. This section describes the forms, views, and dashboards that demonstrate the entities in the data model as well as applications that build out business rules.

This includes the following:

Entities shown in the sample model-driven applications:

* **Constituent management**

  * Complete constituent profiles for individuals, households, and organizations, including biographical details, communication methods, preferences, relationships, salutations, employment and education history, donations, and awards management.

* **Donation management**

  * The sample dashboard for donations includes gift acknowledgements, tracking of individual and organizational pledges and gifts, one-time and recurring gifts, gifts in kind, and grant disbursements.

* **Fundraising**

  * The nonprofit accelerator can track all major stages of high-touch fundraising.

* **Awards management**

  * Awards management data model and sample application including dockets, inquiries, requests, awards recommendations, reviews, reports, budgets, and disbursements.

* **Program delivery**

  * Outcome and result model enables nonprofits to efficiently deliver on their missions, measure results, and communicate impact that includes aligning beneficiaries and funds to the results framework.

* **Membership management**

  * The Membership Category entity establishes membership levels and Membership entity that links Constituents to Membership Category, enabling the creation and tracking of membership over time.

* **IATI processes**

  * IATI is a global campaign to create transparency in the records of how aid money is spent. The initiative hopes to ensure that aid money reaches its intended recipients with goals of improving standards of living worldwide and reducing poverty globally. Nonprofits can now record their fundraising and programmatic activities according to the IATI Organizational and Activity Standards, sync IATI non-embedded code lists with the nonprofit accelerator, and generate IATI Organization and Activity XML files from the nonprofit accelerator.

* **Finance and CRM data integrator**

  * Template data integrator tasks to connect nonprofit accelerator constituents, donations, awards, and programs to Finance and Operations.

* **Case management**

  * Provides building blocks for partners to aid program staff in tracking clients and cases tying cases to specific program goals.

* **Project management & program design**

  * Build a complete delivery framework that tracks activities and progress to a theory of change assuring delivery of programs aligned to indicators and program objectives, budgets, and results.

* **Assessment management**

  * Accurately, consistently, rapidly and efficiently record detailed observations and answer the "who," "where," "what," "how," and "when" questions critical to delivering nimble services


Applications using entities with built-out process and business rules:

* **Program design application**
* **Nonprofit operations toolkit**

  * Small nonprofits are able to centrally manage their award budgets, have workers enter time and expenses through a mobile application, approve submitted time and expenses, and track costs to the budget.
